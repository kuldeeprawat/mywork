        <h2>We Understand</h2>
        <div class="left">
          <p>An intervention is the process of gathering friends and family members with an addicted loved one, with the goal of getting the addict into a recovery program or deciding to take the first step towards change. As you will learn, they are not all the same. We understand that many people experience addiction and its effects in different ways. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>Because of this, we have designed the kind of programs that cover the most common needs for families in need of an addiction intervention program. We also take pride is offering support after the intervention to make sure that you and your loved ones continue to thrive.</p>

              <p>My boyfriend suffered from drug addiction. We had broken up several times and there were times when I thought it was all over. He is really great when he's sober and now I get to be a part of his life in a more healthy way, which is what I really wanted.</p>

              <p>When my wife started shopping heavily, I was very angry at her, We used to fight about money almost every day because of it, and I didn't think her arguments made much sense at all. Now I can see she was doing it because she was hurting. This intervention program was the best call I ever made.</p>

              <p>When my best friend started taking me out to bars, I just thought she was a social drinker. It took me two years to find out that she had a serious problem. Without the Alcohol Intervention program, I don't think I could have been able to help her the way I did.

              <p>I could tell my daughter was in real serious trouble when her grades dropped from A to D. I will never forget the way she struggled to answer simple questions. Now we actually talk about the things that are bothering her instead of ignoring them or trying to cover them up. Thank you for the help -- I needed it!</p>
